## Drone Simulator
A Rust program that dynamically generates simulations of a drone searching for / tracking a target across randomly-generated hostile terrain. Uses Actix Web as a backend API to serve HTTP requests to and from the React frontend. The simulations are rendered and animated in 3D on a WebGL canvas.
